## **User Experience (UX)**

### **Initial Concept**

The idea for the project was to develop a memory game targeted towards children. The concept was to create a loveable character that needed the users help. This was to encourage the users to play the game and hopefully increase their enjoyment of it.

The visual design was to give the impression of the game being played on a witch's work desk. The game window is displayed on an open spell book and is intended to be from the user's perspective.

I included a scoring system to provide greater replayability and entice players to return and improve their scores.

### **User Stories**

- **First Time Visitor Goals**

  1. Understand the rules of the game so I can play without confusion.
  2. I want the page to be responsive so I can play it on the device of my choosing.
  3. I want to be introduced to the character and story of the game.

- **Returning Visitor Goals**

  1. Keep track of my previous scores so I can monitor my improvement.

- **Frequent User Goals**

  1. Challenge myself to achieve the highest score possible.
  2. Follow the games social media accounts.

## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

#### **Primary Palette**

![Primary colour palette used in the project](documentation/palette.jpg)

The colour palette used throughout the project was primarily purples combined with greens. These colours were selected as they're a typically used as a Halloween theme.

With the main character of the game being a witch, I wanted to lean into this theme as much as possible. The specific palette matches colours used for the image of Hazel. This was to connect the character with the world of the game.

#### **Additional Colours**

![Additional colour palette used in the project](documentation/secondary-colours.jpg)

These additional colours were used for the page text and also the footer. The design of the footer was to resemble a witch's cauldron. I wanted the greens used in the footer to have a strong contrast to the background.

### **Typography**

#### **Black Pearl**

![Logo for Black Pearl font](documentation/black-pearl.jpg)

Black Pearl was the font used for the main heading of the page and also the headings for the modals. The whimsical and folktale-like appearance of Black Pearl was chosen to evoke a sense of playfulness in the headings. I wanted the design to have the charm of a children's book.

#### **Fondamento**

![Logo for Fondamento font](documentation/fondamento.jpg)

Fondamento was used for all text and headings throughout the page. The font was selected to enhance the folktale theme. It also aligned with the overarching design concept of the content appearing as if handwritten on the pages of an open book.

Readability was also important, I wanted to ensure the font was legible for the user even at smaller font sizes.

### **Imagery**

![Design concept for page](documentation/concept.jpg)
*Design Concept*

The imagery used, was to reinforce the cartoon style of the world. Everything was to be brightly coloured and compliment the colour palette of the page. I modified the colour for some images using Pixlr to better fit the theme.

The design concept for the page was to be from the players perspective, looking down onto Hazel's worktable. To visually represent this, all images chosen were from a birds-eye view.

This perspective provides a unique viewpoint, immersing players in the whimsical world and enhancing the overall visual experience.

Other colours, such as orange were also included using the images. This was to include additional colours typically used for a Halloween theme.

### **Wireframes**

Wireframes were created using Balsamiq for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes to ensure a responsive design. This approach helps in visualising and planning the layout for multiple devices, providing a consistent user experience.

<img src="documentation/features/responsive.gif">

*Responsive Layout*

</details>

- The layout adapts to various device widths, ensuring a seamless experience for users regardless of their chosen device. This enhances accessibility and usability.

- The layout was created with a mobile first approach and then modified to suit wider screens.

#### **Witch's Workshop**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/workshop-lg.jpg">

*Desktop Layout*

<img src="documentation/features/workshop-md.jpg">

*Tablet Layout*

<img src="documentation/features/workshop-sm.jpg">

*Mobile Layout*

</details>

- My aim was to ensure that the display represented a witch's worktable at all screen sizes.

- To achieve this, I modified the positioning of the background images to better suit the display size.

#### **Book Container**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/book-page.gif">

*Book Container*

</details>

- The concept of the page representing the witch's worktable stemmed from the idea of containing the content within an open book image.

- The book was to convey the idea of a children's story but also to represent a spell book.

- The page content is then altered dynamically, using the buttons to trigger the navigation.

#### **Page Title**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/page-title.gif">

*Page Title*

</details>

- The page title was designed to represent a magical scroll.

- A bright orange and yellow gradient was chosen to give depth to the heading and help it pop against the purple scroll.

- It doubles as a navigation feature for the user and a means of exiting from a game.

#### **Footer**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/footer.jpg">

*Footer Design*

<img src="documentation/features/footer-links.gif">

*Social Media Links*

</details>

- The footer was designed to visually represent a cauldron with its contents spilling over the side.

- The social media links enlarge when the users mouse hovers over. This was to imply interactivity but also give a cartoonish charm to the animation.

#### **Buttons**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/buttons.gif">

*Button Transition*

</details>

- A subtle colour transition was applied to the buttons when hovered over with a mouse.

- This provides feedback to the user that these are interactive elements.

#### **Scrollbar**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/scrollbar.gif">

*Scrollbar*

</details>

- As the book container layout required the use of scrolling content. I decided to include custom styling to the scrollbar.

- This allowed the visual design of the scrollbar to match the theme of the page.

### **Home Page**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/home-page.jpg">

*Home Page Book*

<img src="documentation/features/home-scroll.gif">

*Home Page Story*

</details>

- As an incentive for the user to play the game, a backstory and main character were created.

- With the game being targeted at children, a light-hearted story featuring a cute character was developed.

- A Witch was chosen as I wanted the world and theming to be whimsical.

- The scrollable design of the book page eliminated the need to constrain the page content based on the image size.

### **How To Play Page**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/how-page.jpg">

*How To Play Page Book*

</details>

- With the target audience being children, the assumption that the user might not have played a similar game before led to the creation of comprehensive instructions.

- Core gameplay mechanics, the win condition, and tips for an enjoyable gaming experience were outlined to the user.

### **Game Page**

#### **Score Display**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/score-display.gif">

*Score Display*

</details>

- The score display is the visual indicator to the user of their performance in the game.

- It's split into three sections, the countdown timer, turn counter and score rating.

- The 3-star rating display is updated in real time and triggered by the countdown reaching certain intervals.

- This provides the player with instant feedback as the game progresses.

#### **Game Cards**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/float.gif">

*Card Float*

<img src="documentation/features/flip.gif">

*Card Flip*

<img src="documentation/features/match.gif">

*Card Match*

</details>

- The card back design was chosen as a reference to tarot cards.

- The front images were selected as cartoon imagery that is synonymous with witchcraft.

- I added the floating animation to the cards as a means of highlighting the cards interactive elements.

- The height and width expand at different rates to give a more cartoony feel to the animation.

- The drop shadow was also added to give the impression that the cards were floating rather than enlarging.

- When a single card is clicked by the player it remains floating so they're able to keep track of the currently selected card.

- When a matching pair is found, the pointer cursor is removed to indicate to the player that the cards can no longer be interacted with.

### **High Scores Page**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/high-scores.gif">

*High Scores Page*

<img src="documentation/features/empty-score.jpg">

*Empty Score Board*

</details>

- The High Scores page showcases the top 5 player scores submitted by users.

- By default, the page opens with the score of the top-ranked player prominently displayed.

- The selected player's name is presented in bold, drawing attention to the user's current choice.

- When hovered over, player names are underlined, indicating their selectability.

- In instances where no high scores exist, this section remains empty, encouraging users to set new records.

### **Modals**

<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>

<img src="documentation/features/win-modal.gif">

*Win Modal*

<img src="documentation/features/lose-modal.jpg">

*Lose Modal*

</details>

- The modals were designed to look like a wooden message board and fit into the cartoon style of the page.

- The Win modal celebrates the user's success with a congratulatory message and an image of the completed potion, offering positive reinforcement.

- The overall score, time remaining and turn count are displayed to give feedback to the user.

- Clear instructions on score submission are displayed above the text input field, ensuring user clarity.

- Restrictions prevent users from submitting empty names or names exceeding 10 characters. If triggered, updated instructions offer feedback on errors.

- Upon successful submission, a confirmation message is displayed, and the input field is disabled to prevent duplicate entries.

- The Lose modal signals the end of the game with a "time's up" message and an hourglass image, clarifying the time limit.
  
- An encouraging message prompts the player to retry, providing positive engagement.
