## **User Experience (UX)**

### **Initial Concept**

The idea for the project was to develop a memory game targeted towards children. The concept was to create a loveable character that needed the users help. This was to encourage the users to play the game and hopefully increase their enjoyment of it.

The visual design was to give the impression of the game being played on a witch's work desk. The game window is displayed on an open spell book and is intended to be from the user's perspective.

I included a scoring system to provide greater replayability and entice players to return and improve their scores.

### **User Stories**

- **First Time Visitor Goals**

  1. Understand the rules of the game so I can play without confusion.
  2. I want the page to be responsive so I can play it on the device of my choosing.
  3. I want to be introduced to the character and story of the game.

- **Returning Visitor Goals**

  1. Keep track of my previous scores so I can monitor my improvement.

- **Frequent User Goals**

  1. Challenge myself to achieve the highest score possible.
  2. Follow the games social media accounts.

## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

#### **Primary Palette**

![Primary colour palette used in the project](documentation/palette.jpg)

The colour palette used throughout the project was primarily purples combined with greens. These colours were selected as they're a typical used as a Halloween theme.

With the main character of the game being a witch, I wanted to lean into this theme as much as possible. The specific palette matches colours used for the image of Hazel. This was to connect the character with the world of the game.

#### **Additional Colours**

![Additional colour palette used in the project](documentation/secondary-colours.jpg)

These additional colours were used for the page text and also the footer. The design of the footer was to resemble a witch's cauldron. I wanted the greens used in the footer to have a strong contrast to the background.

### **Typography**

#### **Black Pearl**

![Logo for Black Pearl font](documentation/black-pearl.jpg)

Black Pearl was the font used for the main heading of the page and also the headings for the modals. This font was chosen to invoke the idea of a folktale for the game. I wanted the design to have the charm of a children's book.

#### **Fondamento**

![Logo for Fondamento font](documentation/fondamento.jpg)

Fondamento was used for all text and headings throughout the page. Again, the style chosen was to further the folktale look. With the content of the page being overlaid onto an open book. The idea was that the page content was handwritten.

At the same time, I wanted the font to maintain readability for the user even at the smallest font size used.

### **Imagery**

The imagery used, was to reinforce the cartoon style of the world. Everything was to be brightly coloured and compliment the colour palette of the page. I modified the colour for some images using Pixlr in order to better suit the theme.

The design concept for the page was to be from the players perspective, looking down onto Hazel's workbench. To visually represent this, all images chosen were from a birds-eye view.

Other colours, such as orange were also included using the images. This was to include additional colours typically used for a Halloween theme.

### **Wireframes**

All wireframes were created using Balsamiq for the following screen sizes:
