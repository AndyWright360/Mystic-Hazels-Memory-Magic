                        <h2>Mystic Hazel's Memory Magic</h2>
                        <p>
                            In a whimsical forest nestled deep within an enchanted realm, there lived a charming and thoughtful witch named
                            Hazel.
                            She was known far and wide for her heartwarming spells and ever-present smile, but there was one little problem.
                            Hazel
                            had a memory like a leaky bucket.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a talented potion maker, she decided to fix her poor memory once and for all by creating a memory-boosting
                            elixir!
                            But Hazel can't remember the ingredients to make it. Can you help her find the matching ingredients scattered around
                            her
                            workshop?
                        </p>

                        <h3>How to Play</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                The game board consists of a grid of facedown cards, each hiding an ingredient.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                To play, click on any two cards to reveal what's hidden beneath.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the two cards you've chosen reveal matching ingredients, congratulations! You've found a pair.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the cards don't match, don't worry. The cards will automatically flip back face-down, and you can continue your
                                search for pairs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Continue revealing cards and trying to match pairs. The more pairs you find, the closer Hazel becomes to improving her
                                memory.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                            <li>
                                Once you've successfully matched all the pairs of ingredients, Hazel will be able to create her memory-enhancing potion,
                                and you win the game!
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Concentration is key. Pay attention to the cards you've already revealed and where you saw matching ingredients.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Keep an eye on the number of moves you make. Try to find all the pairs in as few moves as possible.
                            </li>
